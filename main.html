	<p>Puri is a coastal district on the eastern part of Odisha, which is also known as Jagannath Puri</b>. It is known for Lord Jagannath’s temple which is located on the beach side. It is one of the Char Dhaams. ‘Dhaam’ is a Sanskrit word which means “abode” and it is believed that Puri is abode of the Lord. In India there are four important dhams namely, Badrinath in the north, Dwarka in the west, Rameswaram in the south, and Jagannatha Puri in the east. Puri also serves as the site of Govardhana matha, which is one of the four cardinal institutions established by Shri Adi Shankaracharya ji Maharaaj.
